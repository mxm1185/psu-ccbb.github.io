The right choice depends on the exact type of research you are interested in, as well as your educational background. The most common options are:\n Bioinformatics and Genomics (BG) Molecular Cellular and Integrative Biosciences (MCIBS) Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (BMB) Biology (BIOL) Statistics (STAT)  Training grants Traning grants provide external funding for students to participate in training activities outside of their own graduate program. Applications are solicited during the year from students already enrolled in a graduate program. This funding allows students to receive additional training that is not usually part of a graduate program, e.g. additional courses, seminars, or tutorials.\n Computation, Bioinformatics, and Statistics (CBIOS) Training Program Biomedical Big Data to Knowledge (B2D2K)  "

	"content": "The Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics was founded in 2003. Work within the Center has led to many important advances in genome analysis, including groundbreaking work in evolutionary and functional genomics. Algorithms for alignments of entire genome sequences from multiple species were developed here as part of our participation in consortia analyzing genomes of mouse, rat, chicken, rhesus, chimpanzee, and others. These programs are still in common use today. Foundational work applying bioinformatic and statistical approaches to infer function from aligned genome sequences and from epigenetic signals arose from the Center, e.g. during our participation in the ENCODE project. Providing broad access to bioinformatic tools for genome analysis and enabling transparency in analysis has been a consistent theme from the Center, leading to the popular Galaxy platform that is used internationally for analysis of genome data. The Center's diverse membership of both experimental and computational scientists reflects the importance of experimental validations of the bioinformatic and statistical predictions. In 2017, the Center's name was changed to its current one, from the \u0026ldquo;Center for Comparative Genomics and Bioinformatics,\u0026rdquo; to better represent Penn State's dynamic research landscape. It is currently being supported by the Huck Institutes of the Life Sciences and the Institute for Computational and Data Sciences.\n"

	"content": "Pre-doctoral visiting scholar program The Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (CCBB, http://ccbb.psu.edu) at Penn State is soliciting applications to support pre-doctoral visiting scholars. The program is intended for students who are working on their PhDs outside Penn State who would like to visit Penn State for a few months to work on a research project with one of our faculty. International students are welcome. You can use this opportunity to:\n Work with our renowned faculty on a research project that fits your thesis Expand your research horizons by attending our weekly seminars (www.ccbb.psu.edu/seminars). Expose yourself to a vibrant and inter-disciplinary research environment. Prepare for your next career steps by broadening your science network and gaining new experience. Explore an opportunity for a potential postdoc at PSU. Experience life in an idyllic American college town in a multicultural environment.  Interested students can learn more about the research performed at CCBB by visiting the webpages of our faculty (http://www.ccbb.psu.edu/people). After identifying a potential faculty host, please reach out to gauge their interest and develop a plan for the visit. Applications should be submitted by your potential host to ccbb@psu.edu with the following information: name of host and of visiting scholar, CV of visiting scholar, a brief research proposal for the visit (between 100 and 400 words), and the proposed timeline of the stay (should be between 1 and 6 months). Applications are accepted on a rolling basis.\nIf your application is accepted, CCBB will reimburse your travel expenses. Your host may be able to provide you with additional funding, but this is something you should discuss with your host. It is the responsibility of the host to make sure that you qualify for reimbursement prior to the trip being arranged. You and your host may also be asked to fill out a short outcomes survey or otherwise help for reporting purposes.\nFeel free to contact ccbb@psu.edu if you have any questions.\n"
